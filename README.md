## About Me

I am an engineer that loves a challenge and mostly projects where I can apply my skills accross different fields.

I have extended experience in electronics design (circuit, PCB), ASIC design and verification, embedded software (firmware & embedded applications), systems administration, mobile software development, web application development (front/back), ... .

I have coded in a long list of common and less common languages in the electronics field and software fields.

I have my name on a patent in a field that I least expected it in: a PCB design technique for high impedance measurement circuits.

## Projects

Active projects I manage and code on are:

- [ZHA-Toolkit](https://github.com/mdeweerd/zha-toolkit): A description of your first project and what it does.
- [MetersToHA](https://github.com/mdeweerd/MetersToHA): A brief description of your second project and its purpose.

My most popular project was `BT747`, created in 2009 to work with GPS Data Loggers: [https://bt747.org](https://bt747.org) or [https://sourceforge.net/projects/bt747/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bt747/).
