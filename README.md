## About Me

I am an engineer that loves a challenge and mostly projects where I can apply my skills across different fields.

I have extended experience in electronics design (circuit, PCB), ASIC design and verification, embedded software (firmware & embedded applications), systems administration, mobile software development, web application development (front/back), ... .

I have coded in a long list of common and less common languages in the electronics field and software fields.

I have my name on a patent in a field that I least expected it in: a PCB design technique for high impedance measurement circuits.

## Projects

Active projects I manage and code on are:

- [ZHA-Toolkit](https://github.com/mdeweerd/zha-toolkit): Component for Home Assistant - A set of tools (services) for Zigbee devices operating with the ZHA component.
- [MetersToHA](https://github.com/mdeweerd/MetersToHA): Addon/... to fetch data from Utility provides and "inject" them in Domotics Systems (Home Assistant, Domoticz, ...).
- [pre-commit bash-completion](https://github.com/mdeweerd/pre-commit-completion): Complete pre-commit options on the CLI.  Just do `pre-commit run <TAB>` to get/autocomplete hooks.
- [Log to Checkstyle/Github Annotations](https://github.com/mdeweerd/LogToCheckStyle): Github Action to extract the errors/warnings/notices from text and annotate the "PR Files Changed" tab.  Useful with `pre-commit` and other tools.

My most popular project was `BT747`, created in 2009 to work with GPS Data Loggers: [https://bt747.org](https://bt747.org) or [https://sourceforge.net/projects/bt747/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bt747/).


You may want to checkout [my gists](https://gist.github.com/mdeweerd).  
If you're on Home Assistant you can find a [configuration for "Terminal & SSH"](https://gist.github.com/mdeweerd/07918a6a1300fa64f0faf08c7e2a1dd1) that helps you reinstall python modules across restarts, setup `screen` to maintain you SSH session, and also get a colorful prompt and status line.
